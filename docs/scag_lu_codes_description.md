## **Appendix D - Land Use Code Descriptions**

The land use definitions and descriptions were developed by Aerial Information Systems, Inc. as a Modified Anderson Land Use Classification. This classification uses a hierarchical system, allowing easy aggregation and disaggregation of classes. Most uses in the 1990 Land Use Study of Southern California were mapped to the fourth level. The user may elect to use the second or third level, or any variation, in analyses or display. The descriptions below apply to land use characteristics in southern California, and may not apply to other geographic areas.

### **1000 URBAN OR BUILT-UP**

Areas of built-up land characterized by intensive land use, where most of the
land is covered by man-made structures because of human activity.

#### **1100 RESIDENTIAL**

The residential category includes areas of single family residences, multi-unit dwellings, and mobile homes. Also included is a mixed residential category that consists of two or more of the aforementioned groups. The units/acre listed can be used as an indicator of relative density to aid in analysis when using the land use study.

##### _1110 SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENTIAL - Low Density Residential_

These residential areas are typically made up of detached dwellings, where each structure houses a single family, located in an urban or suburban setting. (Single family residential units located in a rural setting are classified as code 1150 under Rural Residential.) These single family residences are usually served by all utilities, are on paved streets, and are provided with or have access to all urban facilities such as schools, parks, police, and fire stations.

Single family residential neighborhoods are normally large contiguous areas of residential lots. Some areas have subdivisions or tracts of homes with similar size or architectural design. Typically, single family lots contain landscaped front and back yards, one driveway, and one walkway either to the sidewalk or to the driveway. The house usually contains one chimney, and one air conditioning unit. Some lots may have swimming pools in the back yards. High or low density is determined by the size of the lot on which the residence is located. If an area is under construction, and the residential lots or pads are easily identifiable, then the unit may be coded with the appropriate density category.

###### _1111	High Density Single Family Residential (9 or more units/acre)_

This category contains single family detached residential units with a unit density of 9 or more units/acre. These units are typically found in modern urban and suburban subdivisions.

###### _1112	Medium Density Single Family Residential (3-8 units/acre)_

This category contains single family detached residential units with a unit density of 3-8 units/acre. These units are typically found in modern urban and suburban subdivisions.

###### _1113	Low Density Single Family Residential (2 or less units/acre)_

This category contains single family detached residential units with a unit density of 2 or less units/acre. These units may include areas of urban ranch homes or estates. Also included are urban areas where single family lots have been established but houses have not been built on all of them and are not likely to be built in the near future. The homes are spaced at a density of 2 or less units/acre. In some situations, a low density area may be rural in appearance because it was once a rural area but is now within the urban setting or a transitional area.

##### _1120 MULTI-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL (Medium-High Density Residential)_

Multi-family units are attached residences, apartments, condominiums, and townhouses. Multi-family residences are usually served by all utilities, are on paved streets, and are provided with or have access to all urban facilities such as schools, parks, police and fire stations. Senior citizen apartment building gs are included in these classes. Also included are off-campus university owned housing and off-campus fraternity/sorority houses.

###### _1121	Mixed Multi-Family RESIDENTIAL_

This category is used when there is a mixture of multi-family uses (duplexes, triplexes, apartments, condominiums, and/or townhouses of any type), and no one type dominates. This situation may occur in older neighborhoods.

###### _1122	Duplexes, Triplexes, and 2- or 3-Unit Condominiums and Townhouses_

This category is composed of duplexes, triplexes, and 2- or 3-unit condominiums and townhouses that are attached multi-family struc-tures.

Duplex and triplex residences may occur together or mixed with single family houses in some older neighborhoods (see code 1121 and 1140). Typically the multi-unit structure is one story located on a lot approximately the same size as nearby single family residential lots. There may be minimal landscaping or yard space. On the aerial photo, one may be able to count the driveways, sidewalks, entryway overhangs, chimneys, or air conditioning units corresponding to the number of units in the structure. Some newer duplexes and triplexes occur as 2- or 3-unit structures in complexes as condominiums and townhouses, with common grounds.

###### _1123	Low-Rise Apartments, Condominiums, and Townhouses_

This category includes multi-family structures of one to two (1-2) stories and approximately 10 to 18 units/acre. The area consists of either a large single structure or a group of structures, of four or more units each, in a complex with associated common grounds, facilities and parking areas.

Typically low-rise apartments, condominiums, and townhouses occur together in large contiguous areas since land use is restricted to multi-family zoned areas. However, in some areas one to a few build-ings may occur on individual lots in single family residential neigh-borhoods. In newer neighborhoods they may appear as a large complex composed of many structures of similar architecture with common grounds and facilities. Some older structures are U-shaped or O-shaped with a swimming pool in the middle. A parking level may be located underneath the living area, in which case it is not counted as a story. Parking for larger complexes may include garages or car-ports along the periphery of the complex. Low-rise apartments and condominiums are the most common types of multi-family structures in the study area. Also included are off-campus fraternity/sorority houses and senior citizen apartments. Residential units located above first floor commercial in buildings along a commercial strip are considered commercial use (1223, 1224). An area mapped as Low-Rise Apartments, Condominiums, and Townhouses may contain an occasional Medium-Rise building.

###### _1124	Medium-Rise Apartments and Condominiums_

This category includes multi-family structures of three to four (3-4) stories and 19 or more units/acre. The area consists of a large single structure or a group of structures, of four or more units each, in a complex with associated common grounds, facilities and parking areas.

Many medium-rise apartments and condominiums occur in older areas as hotel/apartments. Several may be located next to each other in compact areas. Some may occur as large complexes, composed of many structures of similar architecture, with common grounds and facilities. Medium-rise apartments and condominiums are not as common as low-rise. Senior citizen apartments are included. If an area contains commercial use on the first floor and multi-family residential use on the upper floors, then the area is considered strip commercial (codes 1223, 1224). Some older urban core cities contain apartment and condominium buildings predominantly of three, four, or more stories. An area mapped as Medium-Rise may contain occasional Low-Rise or High-Rise buildings.

###### _1125	High-Rise Apartments and Condominiums_

This category includes multi-family structures of five (5) stories or greater (5+) and 19 or more units/acre. The area consists of either a single large structure or a group of adjacent structures with common grounds, facilities and parking areas.

Many high-rise apartments and condominiums occur as single or groups of high residential towers. Parking may be underground or in an adjacent parking structure. Smaller high-rise structures may contain only residential units with no other uses. High-rise residential structures are configured to maximize availability of window access to each individual residential unit. Thus the building may be long and narrow, or contain narrow lateral wings that provide window access. Senior citizen apartments are included. If an area contains commercial use on the first floor and multi-family residential use on the upper floors, then it is considered High-Rise Apartments and Condominiums.

##### _1130 MOBILE HOMES AND TRAILER PARKS_

These residential units are composed of mobile homes, trailers and pre-fabricated housing that are either stationary with foundations or that is on wheels and capable of being moved. Included are vacant and occupied spaces, and associated storage facilities for the complex. Mobile homes and trailer parks are usually served by all utilities, are on paved streets, and are provided with or have access to all urban facilities, such as schools, parks, police, and fire stations. This category does not include transient facilities such as recreational vehicle parks or campgrounds (see code 1880).

Mobile homes are typically long, narrow, and rectangular in shape. Most have a white signature when represented on an aerial photo, although some modern mobile homes may have a less reflective or colored roofing material. Some newer modular home or mobile home courts and subdivisions contain homes with false facades, giving the impression of an apartment or condominium complex, or single family houses.

###### _1131	Trailer Parks and Mobile Home Courts, High Density_

This category includes typical mobile home or trailer parks and pre-fabricated homes (6 or more units per acre) that are in a contiguous area with trailer or mobile home spaces and associated facilities.

Trailer courts and mobile home parks normally have a high, closely spaced density of units within the lot with very limited landscaping. The mobile homes are parked side by side in parallel rows with an access drive along the front of the row. Also included are associated recreational vehicle storage lots within or next to the mobile home park.

###### _1132	Mobile Home Courts and Subdivisions, Low Density_

This category includes typical mobile and pre-fabricated homes located in lower density mobile home park or in a single family residential subdivision pattern on curbed named streets (less than 6 units per acre).

Individual mobile homes appear as in the description above (1131), although there may be additional architectural modification associated with it. Units are more widely spaced, with landscaping as in front and back yard areas of a normal subdivision. Each lot has its own driveway or walkway, similar to single family residential areas. Also included are associated recreational vehicle storage lots within or next to the mobile home park.

##### _1140 MIXED RESIDENTIAL_


This category includes areas where there is a combination of single family detached and multi-family dwellings of any type occurring together. Typically these are located in older neighborhoods, where duplexes, triplexes, and apartment buildings occur among single family houses.

##### _1150 RURAL RESIDENTIAL_


Rural Residential units include ranches, farmsteads, single mobile homes, and residences located in a rural setting. Rural residential density varies based on locations of geographic area in SCAG region. The density range could be one (1) unit per acre to one (1) unit per 10 acre. Typically these areas have limited urban services.

#### **1200 COMMERCIAL AND SERVICES**
Commercial and Services includes areas used predominantly for business or the sale of products and their associated services. Also included are some non-commercial uses such as government and public service offices. This class does not include industrial activities.

##### _1210 GENERAL OFFICE USE_
Included are areas of office buildings usually used for financial, personnel, business, medical and other professional services. The unit includes associated facilities and parking areas.

###### _1211	Low- to Medium-Rise Major Office Use_
This category includes office buildings of one to ten stories in height.

Office buildings are usually located on or adjacent to major streets, depending on the need for high visibility. Offices have parking areas either behind or around the buildings. Typically there are two styles of building structures. Normally, the low-rise office buildings (one to four stories in height) try to maximize window access, resulting in buildings that are long and narrow, containing a central court-yard, or have lateral wings. Medium-rise office buildings (five to ten stories in height) tend to be square, or rectangular in shape. Landscaping can vary from minimal to extensive, although modern larger office buildings do have considerable surrounding landscaped areas. Utility administrative offices are included in this category. Some corporate or business parks may be entirely made up of, or predominantly contain office space, although they may be similar to light industrial complexes (1311) or mixed commercial and industrial complexes (1500).

If an area contains commercial strip use on the first floor and offices on the upper floors (3 - 10 stories), then the area is considered Low- to Medium-Rise Major Office Use. A commercial strip of two-story structures containing offices on the upper floors is considered retail strip development (1223).

###### _1212	High-Rise Major Office Use _
This category includes office buildings that are eleven to forty stories in height.

The characteristics of the smaller high-rise office buildings are similar to medium-rise office buildings as described above. The taller office buildings are typically rectangular, with no particular regard for window accessibility. Older office buildings may be located side by side with retail commercial on the first floor. Modern suburban office buildings may have their own parking areas or landscaped surroundings. Many taller office buildings will have underground parking, or parking on the first few levels.

###### _1213	Skyscrapers_
This category includes office buildings greater than forty stories in height.

Skyscrapers are the tallest buildings built, normally occurring in downtown areas of larger cities, although they can also be located in business districts not associated with a downtown area. Retail commercial use usually occurs on the ground floor, with office use on the upper floors. Their relative height compared to surrounding areas is evident when the photos are viewed in stereo. Parking may be underground, on the first few levels, or in adjacent parking structures.

##### _1220 RETAIL STORES AND COMMERCIAL SERVICES_
Areas composed primarily of retail stores, restaurants, offices, and personal services, including associated facilities and parking areas.

###### _1221	Regional Shopping Center_
This category includes large retail centers composed of one or more major department stores and a full range of smaller shops, restaurants, offices and commercial services.

Most regional centers are enclosed malls, which are typically one to three stories in height, elongate in shape, with large square protru-sions formed by the large department stores, the areas between being the smaller retail stores, services, and restaurants. Usually parking areas totally surround the building, some of which may be parking structures. Businesses located within the contiguous parking area are included with the regional shopping center. In urban areas, where open space may be limited, the mall building may be located over an entire block, with parking underground, and no visible surface parking. Factory outlet centers are included in this category.

###### _1222	Retail Centers (Non-Strip with Contiguous Interconnected Off-Street Parking)_
This category includes a large magnet store, with smaller retail stores, restaurants, service shops, and offices located in shopping centers with contiguous interconnected off-street parking. These centers are normally located along major highways and traffic corridors to take advantage of the increased customer exposure. Included are gasoline stations, restaurants and other stores whose parking area is contiguous with the center. Included are some grocery store, drug store, and department store shopping centers.

Retail or shopping centers contain buildings that are typically rectangular in shape with some architectural protrusions spaced at intervals when viewed on an aerial photo. The smaller stores are housed in long, narrow portions of the building, the larger stores are in the larger square portions. The building is usually situated toward the rear of the lot, with parking on the street side. There may be smaller commercial buildings within the parking area. Usually there is minimal to no landscaping.

Also included in this category are thematic commercial centers that function as a tourist attraction with specialty shops and restaurants.

###### _1223	Retail Strip Development_
This category includes retail stores, restaurants, service shops, and offices aligned along major highways and traffic corridors to take advantage of the increased customer exposure. Included are gasoline stations, auto repair shops, convenience stores, liquor stores, small bank branch offices, clothing stores, restaurants, furniture stores, discount stores, novelty stores, car dealerships or auto centers, drug stores, small corner markets, auctions, and mini-malls. In addition to on-street parking, there is easy access to off-street parking areas, that can be found in the front, on the side, as well as behind the commercial establishments. This category includes most newer style business corridors built since the 1950's.

Included are modern commercial corridors, usually containing a mixture of commercial uses along major highways. Some lots contain one building toward the back of the lot with no major store, and a small parking lot on the street side. Strip Development areas are typically located on major streets to take advantage of the high visibility. Usually there is minimal to no landscaping. Mini-malls are similar to shopping centers except they contain no large or magnet store. Older style strip development areas are also included in class 1223.

##### _1230 OTHER COMMERCIAL_
Commercial uses other than general office, typical retail stores, and/or personal services. Included in this category are associated facilities and parking areas.

###### _1231	Commercial Storage_
This category includes public mini storage unit facilities and small commercial storage yards. This class does not include large storage warehouses (see code 1340).

Mini storage facilities are normally composed of a series of long, narrow parallel rectangular buildings, sometimes encompassed by a U-shaped or L-shaped building. Also included in this category are RV or large vehicle storage lots which, in some cases, are adjacent to mini storage unit facilities.

###### _1232	Commercial Recreation_
This category includes areas of commercial recreational use, such as sports stadiums (not associated with schools), car and horse race tracks, indoor shooting ranges, amusement parks, fairgrounds, gambling facilities (card halls and Indian bingo), and movie theaters (all drive-in and some walk-in types). Zoos are not included in this class, but are mapped as class 1850.

School sports facilities are mapped with the appropriate school category (e.g. a high school track would be called "High School"). Race tracks in this category do not include isolated or rural horse exercise or training tracks (see code 2700). Drive-in theaters are pie slice-shaped areas with concentric arcs within, as seen on aerial photos. Other examples include walk-in theaters not located in a mall or retail center, bowling alleys, ice and roller skating rinks, miniature golf courses, and small amusement facilities. Facilities such as bowling alleys and skating rinks may need to be verified and coded in the field since, on the photo, they resemble other types of land uses. Some categories, such as race tracks, some amusement parks, and fairgrounds, may already be identified on the collateral maps.

###### _1233	Hotels and Motels_
This category includes all major hotels and motels. Small or inactive motels which may be less than 2.5 acres may be classified as strip commercial. Large hotels usually contain varied commercial activity on-site (e.g. restaurant, barber/beauty salons, bar, gift shops, etc.). Motels, however, tend to be limited to an office and individual units.

Hotels, motels, suites, inns, and motor lodges tend to be located along major transportation corridors, near airports, large amusement parks, convention centers, civic centers, and/or downtown areas to take advantage of the potential market of transient overnight or extended-stay travellers. Smaller facilities normally contain a series of one- or two-story buildings with parking within the complex, or surrounding the buildings. Landscaping may be minimal. Usually there is a swimming pool toward the front or middle of the lot. Restaurants and gas stations are located in the immediate area. Large hotels tend to be greater than three stories in height. In order to maximize window access the building configurations are long and narrow in shape, or contain narrow lateral wings. Parking may be underground, in parking structures, or in open areas around the hotel complex. Older hotels and motel may be located along what once was a major transportation corridor, but the major corridor has since been moved to a freeway in another location.


##### _1240 PUBLIC FACILITIES_
Public Facilities include government offices and other public service facilities, major health care facilities, religious facilities, and public and private educational facilities. This class also includes associated facilities and parking areas. Collateral data aids in the identification of these facilities.

###### _1241	Government Offices_
This category includes federal, state, regional, county or municipal administrative office buildings. Also included in this category are post offices, courthouses, and school district offices. In the suburban areas the offices will usually be one to two stories in height, with landscaping and parking.

###### _1242	Police and Sheriff Stations_
This category includes all municipal, county sheriff, and state highway patrol police stations. Police stations in a military installation are not included.

###### _1243	Fire Stations_

###### _1244	Major Medical Health Care Facilities_
This category includes public and private general medical health care facilities (hospitals) that give short- term care.

Larger hospitals are normally multi-storied, with split-level recessed/tiered upper floors that may form long and narrow lateral wings in order to maximize availability of window access for patient rooms. The area may contain other associated buildings, parking structures, parking areas, and landscaping. Smaller hospitals are one to two stories in height, with parking areas and landscaping. In both cases there may be circular drives with covered main entrances. Some facilities contain a number of buildings forming a complex. Medical offices are often located in close proximity to medical health care facilities. Some medical school facilities may be included as part of a major medical health care facility complex.

###### _1245	Religious Facilities_
This category includes churches, mosques, synagogues, temples, tabernacles, and other places of worship or religious pursuit. Religious monasteries, convents, etc. are also included in this category. Not included are schools (see 1262 through 1264), communication (see code 1420) and mass media facilities (see code 1211 and 1212) associated with a religious denomination.

Worship facilities are normally below the 2.5-acre minimum mapping resolution. They appear as one main building with landscaping and parking areas. Some facilities have a grass play area, or other smaller buildings. Monasteries and convents may appear as large office-type or apartment-type buildings in a closed compound with parking areas and substantial landscaping. Religious facilities may be identified on the topographic base maps, but that source may not be current. Small cemeteries, less than 2.5 acres that are associated with an adjacent church are included with the church. Religious camps are mapped as code 1880. Retreat or conference centers are mapped as code 1253.

###### _1246	Other Public Facilities_
This category includes convention centers, and other public facili-ties, such as libraries, community centers, auditoriums, live indoor and outdoor theater facilities, observatories and museums, which are not covered by other categories.

Convention centers may appear as very large rectangular to square building complexes with some architectural design. There is much landscaping and surface parking, parking structures, or underground parking. Convention centers are usually located in downtown civic center areas, central business districts, or near major airports.

Many public facilities in this category resemble office buildings in appearance. Outdoor theaters appear as large amphitheater areas with concentric seating pattern. Libraries, auditoriums, observatories, museums, and community centers are usually identified on collateral sources.

###### _1247	Public Parking Facilities_
This category includes public parking areas where with or without attendant-cashier is present.

Most public parking facilities occur in older strip development areas (code 1224). Most of these parking facilities are located in the central business districts of suburban cities or community centers. The parking facility is usually located behind or across the street from the old commercial strip.

##### _1250 SPECIAL USE FACILITIES_
Special Use Facilities include institutional type facilities such as correctional institutions, mental health institutions, convalescent health care facilities, non-profit institutions, and fraternal organizations.

###### _1251	Correctional Facilities_
This category includes large facilities providing institutional services, such as juvenile halls, youth correctional facilities, county jailhouses, federal and state prisons, and state correctional mental hospitals (also see code 1252).

These institutions may be several acres in size, with many "office-type" or "apartment-type" buildings, landscaping, and parking areas, all confined to a closed complex. Other uses, such as agriculture, occurring within the correctional facility grounds are mapped separately.

###### _1252	Special Care Facilities_
This category includes public and private institutional care, such as convalescent and rehabilitation facilities, nursing homes, mental health facilities, sanitariums and state non-correctional mental hospitals. Also included are reform schools, orphanages, and homes for abused, neglected, or other special needs children. This class does not include senior citizen apartments (see codes 1121, 1122, 1123, 1124, and 1125).

Larger facilities are normally multi-storied, with split level recess-tiered upper floors that may form long and narrow lateral wings in order to maximize availability of window access for patient or resident rooms. The area may contain other associated buildings, parking structures, parking areas, and landscaping. Smaller facili-ties are one to two stories in height, with parking areas and landscaping. In both cases there may be circular drives with covered main entrances. Residential and mental health facilities may contain "office-type" or "apartment-type" buildings, landscaping, and parking areas in a closed complex.

###### _1253	Other Special Use Facilities_
This category includes fraternal and other non-profit organizations, such as Salvation Army, Goodwill Industries, YMCA, youth organizations, homeless shelters, etc. Also included are retreat or conference centers.

This category includes a wide range of photo signatures. Many of the facilities in this category are similar to office buildings in appearance. Some may occur in retail commercial areas. Some fraternal organizations, however, may take on the appearance of churches or other religious facilities. YMCA and YWCA facilities may contain recreational facilities such as swimming pools, gymnasiums, baseball fields, etc. Some facilities may appear in industrial areas, such as Goodwill Industries.

##### _1260 EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS_
All levels of public and private schools, colleges, universities, seminaries, and training centers are covered by this category. Includes buildings, open space, dormitories, and parking areas. Also included are all athletic facilities, such as ball fields, stadiums, soccer fields, swimming pools, and tennis courts.

###### _1261	Pre-Schools/Day Care Centers_
This category includes public and private pre-schools, nursery schools, and day care centers. Facilities associated with other educational institutions or religious facilities are not included in this category.

Most pre-schools/day care centers are below the 2.5-acre minimum mapping resolution. Typically, pre-schools and day care centers are located in commercial areas within close proximity to residential neighborhoods. The facility can appear similar to any commercial type use, however, it will usually contain playground equipment within a fenced lot.

###### _1262	Elementary Schools_
This category includes public and private schools, kindergarten through sixth grade, kindergarten through eighth grade, or other beginning grade levels, depending on local school board or administration policy.

Normally buildings are one or two stories in height, though some higher storied buildings may be present. The area contains landscaping and walkways. Buildings are either long and rectangular or have long narrow wings to maximize availability of window access. The play area can be a gray photo signature of asphalt, or a green signature of grass, or both. Elementary schools are usually much smaller than the other types of schools, normally less than 10 acres in size. The parking lot is very small, and may contain a bus loading curb or area. If a school serves a narrower or wider range of grade levels, then the school is assigned the class that the facility typically resembles.

###### _1263	Middle Schools_
This category includes public and private schools for grades seven through eight, seven through nine, or other intermediate grade levels, depending on local school board or administration policy. Intermediate and Middle Schools may be included in this category.

Normally buildings are one or two stories in height, though some higher storied buildings may be present. The area contains landscap-ing and walkways. The buildings are either long and rectangular or have long narrow wings to maximize availability of window access. The athletic area may have a gray photo signature representing asphalt and a larger area of grass which is used as the soccer field/baseball diamond/track. Some schools will have a swimming pool or tennis courts. A parking lot with bus loading curb area may be visible. Junior high schools appear similar to high schools, but have smaller parking and athletic facilities. A junior high school lot is normally about 10 to 20 acres in size. If a school serves a narrower or wider range of grade levels, then the school is assigned the class that the facility typically resembles.

###### _1264	High Schools_
This category includes public or private schools for grades ten through twelve, nine through twelve, or other upper grade levels, which are authorized to grant a high school diploma. Both regular, alternative, and extended day or adult education campuses are included. Seminary high schools are also included.

Buildings are either long and rectangular or have long narrow wings to maximize availability of window access. The athletic area may be a gray signature of asphalt, with a larger area of grass for a soccer field. There are also separate baseball diamond/fields, football fields/stadiums, and track ovals.

Some schools will have a swimming pool and tennis courts. A parking lot with bus loading curb area may be visible. One may find a series of buses parked there.  A senior high school lot is normally about 20 to 50 acres in size. If the school serves a narrower or wider range of grade levels, then the school is assigned the class that the facility typically resembles.

###### _1265	Colleges and Universities_
This category includes all public or private schools that offer courses at grade level 13 or higher, conferring either professional or academic degrees. Post-high school seminaries are also included.

Normally buildings are one to four stories in height, though higher storied buildings may be present. Buildings are either long and rectangular or have long narrow lateral wings to maximize availabil-ity of window access. Some buildings, such as libraries, auditoriums, and gymnasiums, may be rectangular in shape. Many buildings have architectural design in their shapes and features. Areas within the school may be well landscaped, containing walkways, glades, quads, squares, large lawn areas, greens, or malls. Athletic areas may be separate from the main school area. Asphalt areas for basketball may be present. There are also separate baseball fields, football stadiums, track ovals, tennis courts, and swimming pools. Small streets and parking areas may be located throughout the complex. Dormitories and on-campus fraternity/sorority houses are included. Off-campus university-owned housing and off-campus fraternity/sorority houses may be mapped as a multi-family or single-family residential category.

###### _1266	Trade Schools and Professional Training Facilities_
This category includes all schools which provide technical, vocational, occupational, or professional training (e.g. vocational schools, occupational training centers, police academies, secretarial schools, nursing academies, technical institutes, or art institutes).

These facilities are normally smaller than and may identify themselves as, a college or university. Most facilities will be smaller than a high school and without the athletic facilities normally associated with other schools. Buildings may be any size, but normally one to two stories in height, resembling office buildings. Some buildings may be long and narrow to maximize availability of window access. The facility will have an adjacent parking area.

##### _1270 MILITARY INSTALLATION_

#### **2100 CROPLAND AND IMPROVED PASTURE LAND**
Included here are active field and row cropland areas and improved pasture lands. The croplands include cultivated, in crop, harvested, fallow or temporarily idle land. The improved pasture land may be in pasture year-around or be in the cropland seasonal rotation. Improved pasture land does not include rangeland (see code 3100).

##### _2110 Irrigated Cropland and Improved Pasture Land_
This category includes all irrigated field and row cropland areas, and irrigated improved pasture land.

The majority of row crops in southern California is irrigated. The photo signature for active cropland will show one of several signatures. If the land is in field crop, the signature will show a uniform, smooth texture area, with a green color. Land that is in row crop will appear similar to field crop, except the individual rows can be distinguished as narrow parallel lineations. Land that is being made ready for crop or has been harvested will appear as a uniform, smooth texture of off-white to tan color representing the just graded or plowed field. Fallow fields will appear similar to vacant lots or disturbed vacant land. The area will appear unkept, with a non-uniform texture representing a mixture of shrubs and grasses in a successional state. Fallow land will occur in close proximity to in-crop areas. The improved pasture land photo signature may appear similar to the cropland signature. Most improved pasture lands are mapped as non-irrigated (2120). In many cases post-harvest field crop, row crop, or fallow area will be used for pasture of livestock. Cropland and improved pastures may occur within electrical transmission line rights-of-way.

##### _2120 Non-Irrigated Cropland and Improved Pasture Land_
This category includes all non-irrigated cropland, including dry-farmed field crops.

Most non-irrigated cropland is represented by dry-farmed field crops such as peas, beans, barley, oats, and hay. The photo signature for field crop will show a dull green to mottled brown color with smooth, uniform texture. Furrows or plow marks may also be visible. Dry farmed areas may appear very similar to natural grass vegetation. Land that is being made ready for crop or has been harvested will appear as a uniform, smooth texture of off-white to tan color representing the just graded or plowed field. Fallow fields will appear similar to vacant lots or disturbed vacant land. The area will appear unkempt, with a non-uniform texture representing a mixture of shrubs and grasses in a successional state. Fallow land will occur in close proximity to in-crop areas.

#### **2200 ORCHARDS AND VINEYARDS**
This category includes commercially productive tree, bush, and vine crops.

Orchards include fruit and nut trees, and bush crops. The photo signature for citrus orchards appear as dark green, coarse textured areas, where the individual trees are distinguishable. The trees are aligned in a matrix form, with crowns appearing to abut each other. Nut and other fruit trees are similar, however, the color will be a lighter shade of green. The trees are aligned in a matrix form, with crowns abutting each other. Bush crops are similar to orchards, however, they may be configured in rows rather than a matrix, and are much shorter in height. The photo signature for vineyards will appear as dark green, coarse-textured, thin linear rows that, when measured, will be approximately five to ten feet apart. The height of vineyards is shorter than orchards. The orchard and vineyard areas will be neat and uniform. Orchard areas typically are formed as square plots of land, whereas vineyard plots typically form two sections on a similar-sized plot of land. In many cases orchards occur within electrical transmission line rights-of way. It is important to use stereo viewing, to avoid confusing vineyards with row crops.

#### **2300 NURSERIES**
This category includes land managed for the production of ornamental trees, plants and flowers, vegetable seedlings, seed farms, sod farms, and wholesale greenhouses.

Nurseries typically appear similar to row crops in configuration. The photo signature, however, reveals that it is an area of non-uniformity, where a few rows appear similar, then the next few rows are of a different type of plant, and so on. Trees may occur in some rows, then plants in the next section. Greenhouses or hot houses may also occur in some row areas, or in separate areas altogether. Greenhouses typically appear as long narrow structures abutting each other with steeply pitched roofs.
Together the roofs give an accordion effect.

In many cases nurseries occur within electrical transmission line rights-of-way. Also included in this category are Christmas tree farms, which appear on the photo as groves with uneven spacing, smaller crown cover, and open space between the trees. On the aerial photo, sod farms appear similar to pasture or field crop; therefore, some field verification is necessary. Abandoned greenhouse structures are mapped as 2300.

#### **2400 DAIRY AND INTENSIVE LIVESTOCK, AND ASSOCIATED FACILITIES**
This category includes large, specialized livestock and other specialty farms. These areas have a high concentration of animal population in a relatively small area. This class includes beef cattle feed lots, dairies, hog farms, and goat farms.

Livestock feedlots and dairies appear similar in that both contain a series of small fenced areas with a very high concentration of animals. Dairies contain simple rectangular shade structures that are evenly and widely spaced over the area. Structures for protecting stored hay bales may be present. Dairies also contain structures used for milking.

Both feedlot and dairies contain fenced areas with a very dark to black photo signature representing dung piles.  Large fertilizer mounds associated with dairies are mapped as 2600. Pasture and field crop adjacent to and associated with dairies are mapped as 2110. Abandoned dairy structures are mapped as 2400.

#### **2500 POULTRY OPERATIONS**
This category includes poultry operations such as chicken, turkey, and egg farms.

Poultry farms typically contain a series of long, narrow enclosed structures in a parallel, side-by-side configuration. The photo signature shows each structure as having a white pitched roof, typically with air conditioning units. Grain feed storage structures may be located at the ends of the building. One to ten structures may occur in each group. Major poultry manure spreading grounds are coded 2600.

#### **2600 OTHER AGRICULTURE**
This category includes other miscellaneous agricultural facilities not described in the agricultural categories above. These facilities include storage facilities, dairy fertilizer piles, poultry manure spreading grounds, hydroponic farms, fish hatcheries, apiaries, and worm farms. Also included are backyard lots of mixed agricultural/non-agricultural use that meet the MMU.

Storage facilities can include isolated barns, or other structures located in, or adjacent to an agricultural area. Also included are small plots of land where heavy equipment or machinery is stored within the agricultural field area. Fish hatcheries may be identified on the basemap or on the collateral maps. Typically they appear as a series of small square or rectangular ponds adjacent to several small buildings. Track ovals not associated with a horse ranch are coded 2600. Backyard agriculture may include improved pastures, barns, and/or corrals. These areas are mapped as part of the residential class if the land use is less than 2.5 acres in size.

#### **2700 HORSE RANCHES**
This category includes commercial and non-commercial horse ranches, stables, tracks, barns, and corral areas, and improved pastureland. The 2700 class also includes backyard horse facilities, i.e. track ovals, walking rings, stables, barns, etc., that meet the MMU.   Horse racing track facilities are mapped as Commercial Recreation (code 1232).

Stables appear as one or more long, narrow buildings within a farm complex, adjacent to pastures (irrigated pastures are coded as 2110). Horse tracks are large dirt oval tracks located at the horse ranches. Track ovals not associated with a horse ranch are coded 2600. Corral areas, included horse corrals associated with residential areas, are coded 2700. Improved pasture areas are fenced, containing water troughs, and possibly shade structures or enclosures. Improved pastures differ from fenced rangeland in that pasture contains smaller fenced areas, typically with individual enclosures of less than one hundred acres. Horse ranches may also occur within electrical transmission line rights-of-way.

### **3000 VACANT**
Vacant areas include land that has not been built-up with man-made structures, and contains no agriculture or waterbody. The area is open, containing natural or disturbed natural vegetation. Rangeland is included in this category. Areas containing abandoned structures are mapped as their previous use.

#### **3100 Vacant Undifferentiated**
This category represents most occurrences of vacant land.

This class does not include vacant lots in urbanized areas (see code 1900), although terraced erosion control embankments are included. Also included in this category are road cuts. Undeveloped areas of parks are also included. Most vacant land is in a natural state, containing tree, brush/shrub, and/or grassland vegetation. No or few significant structures or improvements are present. Rangeland may be open land or fenced over large areas. Rangeland vegetation may be no different than open vacant land, or may contain grassland for grazing livestock. Eucalyptus groves are also included.

#### **3200 Abandoned Orchards and Vineyards**
This category includes orchards and vineyards, formerly productive, now abandoned and not in commercial production.

Abandoned orchards and vineyards may contain successional or weedy vegetation between the rows. The photo signature may show and the field check may verify an unkept condition. Many trees or vine plants may be dead, or totally removed. If a significant number of trees remain on the lot, then the polygon is coded 3200. If most trees have been removed, then the polygon is mapped as Urban Vacant (code 1900) or Vacant Undifferentiated (code 3100).

#### **3300 Vacant With Limited Improvements**
This category includes areas where streets have been laid in a subdivision pattern, but no further building or improvements have oc-curred over time.

Typically, the photo will show a network of streets, dirt or paved, but with no structures. The lots will be vacant, with natural vegetation.

#### **3400 Beaches (Vacant)**
This category is used for vacant coastal beach areas not associated with a national, state, county, or municipal beach park.

The photo shows a white to tan signature of the sand area. The collateral data does not show these areas to be beach parks.

### **4000 WATER**
Water includes open water bodies which are greater than 2.5 acres in size.

#### **4100 Water, Undifferentiated**
This category includes all open water bodies greater than 2.5 acres in area not associated with water storage; and all water bodies associated with water storage that are greater than 5 acres in size. Included in this class are oceans, lakes, reservoirs, golf course ponds, rivers, estuaries, and channels. The water must occur perennially.

Water body delineations follow those depicted on the 7.5 minute U.S.G.S. topographic quadrangles, unless the configuration of the water body has changed significantly. Water bodies at low water levels are mapped at their normal levels to account for drought years. The photo signature for water is blue to dark blue.

#### **4200 Harbor Water Facilities**
This category includes the water portion of harbor facilities. These include the slips and berths where the ships load and unload, the shipping channels, and outer harbor area within the outer jetty.

#### **4300 Marina Water Facilities**
This category includes the water portion of marina facilities composed primarily of the boat mooring areas. The aerial photo will show an area of buoys or anchorages where the small pleasure boats moor or "park".

#### **4400 Water within a Military Installation**
This category includes all water bodies within a Military Installation of 2.5 acres or larger in size.

#### **4500 Area of Inundation (High Water)**
This category includes the areas of water inundation. This occurs at the Salton Sea and includes the area from the basemap's designated shoreline to the 1990 shoreline as shown on the aerial photo. This situation also occurs at Lake Skinner where the 1990 shoreline is greater than the basemap shoreline.

### **8888 Undevelopable or Protected Land**
This category is a new category in the 2012 version. The category include, but are not limited to, the areas of slopes greater than 15 degree, designated endangered species and plants, wetlands, flood ways, and natural habitat.

### **9999 Unknown**
Areas in which no land use information was available.
