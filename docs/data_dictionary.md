## **Appendix A - Data Dictionary**

### **_Basemaps_**

This group of layers features recent, high-resolution imagery and street maps where users can select as a base or background layer and identify street and road network with street names and address search. These layers as ‘served’ directly from commercial or related services into the SPM system.

![Mapbox Aerial](images/scag_10_11_17/mapbox_aerial.png) _Mapbox Aerial Photo_

Mapbox’s aerial imagery along with street, building, and other useful labels.

![Mapbox Simple Streets](images/scag_10_11_17/mapbox_simple_streets.png) _Mapbox Simple Streets_

Mapbox’s streets and related labels, on a standard map.

![Open Street Map](images/scag_10_11_17/openstreetmap.png) _Open Street Map_

Streets and related labels on a standard map served by OpenStreetMap.

### **_Editable Layers_**

The following layers grouped under Editable Layers present jurisdictional level land use and modeling boundaries that include editable fields. General Plan, zoning, existing land use, specific plan, entitlement and infill opportunity data are shown at the parcel level. Because SCAG’s parcel level database does not support multiple uses on a single parcel, data may be generalized in some areas. Due to this limitation, if site specific data is necessary, users should always reference a local agency’s adopted documents or field surveys to determine actual land use designations.

![2016_existing_land_use_parcels](images/scag_10_11_17/2016_existing_land_use_parcels.png) _2016 SCAG Existing Land Use Parcels_

The base year of the 2020-2045 RTP/SCS is 2016. To develop the 2016 existing land use data, SCAG used property land use information acquired from Digital Map Products (DMP) and SCAG’s 2012 existing land use data. DMP land use codes were converted to SCAG’s standardized Land Use code system. For detailed information on the Land Use codes, please refer to Appendix C.

![general_plan_parcels](images/scag_10_11_17/general_plan_parcels.png) _2016 SCAG General Plan Parcels_

The general plan documents, maps, and/or GIS shapefiles collected from local jurisdictions were coded into GIS shapefiles at the parcel level. Parcel boundary data were acquired from DMP. The General Plan Parcels layer is prepared with SCAG’s standardized Land Use codes. For detailed information on the standardized Land Use codes, please refer to Appendix C.

![specific_plan_parcels](images/scag_10_11_17/general_plan_parcels.png) _2016 SCAG Specific Plan Parcels_

This is parcel-based SCAG’s regional specific plan dataset (February 2017 version). Beginning in August 2016, SCAG staff collected local specific plan information to ensure the data reflects the most current specific plan data. The specific plan documents, maps and/or GIS shapefiles collected were coded into GIS shapefiles at the parcel level. The data shown in some areas may be generalized, because the parcel level database representing specific plan data does not support multiple uses or designations on a single parcel (either splitting the parcel or representing overlays). Due to this limitation, if site specific data is necessary, users should always reference a local agency's adopted documents to determine actual specific plan land use designations. Please note this dataset may undergo changes as SCAG continues to update its land use datasets in collaboration with local jurisdictions in the SCAG Region.

![zoning_parcels](images/scag_10_11_17/general_plan_parcels.png) _2016 SCAG Zoning Parcels_

This is parcel-based SCAG's regional zoning dataset (October 2017 version). Beginning in August 2016, SCAG staff collected local zoning information to ensure the data reflects the most current zoning data. The zoning ordinances, maps and/or GIS shapefiles collected were coded into GIS shapefiles at the parcel level. The data shown in some areas may be generalized, because the parcel level database representing zoning codes does not support multiple uses or designations on a single parcel (either splitting the parcel or representing overlays). Due to this limitation, if site specific data is necessary, users should always reference a local agency's adopted documents to determine actual zoning standards. Please note this dataset may undergo changes as SCAG continues to update its land use datasets in collaboration with local jurisdictions in the SCAG Region.


![entitlement_parcels](images/scag_10_11_17/entitlement_parcels.png) _2016 Entitlement Parcels_

Based on feedback from stakeholders and as an enhancement to the Bottom-Up Local Input Process for the 2016-2040 Regional Transportation Plan and Sustainable Communities Strategy (RTP/SCS), convened the Entitlement Working Group comprised of professionals in the building industry and development services to help inform the update of local data for use in the 2020 RTP/SCS. The working group assessed and enhanced SCAG’s entitlement geodatabase to ensure that details on future development projects are reflected in the regional growth forecast and future land use scenarios for the 2020 RTP/SCS. The working group also provided feedback on how best to engage with stakeholders to ensure the accuracy of SCAG’s local data—including the density, intensity, and phasing of planned development projects. Based on the inputs provided by the working group, SCAG staff collected entitlement information to develop its regional entitlement dataset. Please note this dataset may undergo changes as SCAG continues to update its entitlement datasets in collaboration with local jurisdictions in the SCAG Region.


![infill_parcels](images/scag_10_11_17/entitlement_parcels.png) _Parcels with Potential Infill Opportunity_

Commissioned by the California Business, Transportation and Housing Agency, the Institute of Urban and Regional Development (IURD) at University of California, Berkeley, published a report, ‘The Future of Infill Housing in California: Opportunities, Potential, Feasibility and Demand’ in 2005. The statewide infill study was designed to provide an assessment of infill opportunities, a robust estimate of how many housing units might reasonably be built on available infill sites, and an evaluation of the critical market and policy gaps that remain to be filled. Amongst the objectives of the IURD’s study is to develop a statewide, parcel-based inventory of potential infill sites. The study identified infill sites as vacant or potentially redevelopable parcels located in existing urban neighborhoods, based on an analysis of county assessors’ parcel data. To conduct the infill analysis for the SCAG Region, SCAG staff applied the similar approach to identify potential infill sites by using the most recent county assessor’s property information obtained from the Digital Map Product (DMP) in October 2016. Additionally, staff utilized SCAG’s regional land use datasets and publicly available reference information, including but not limited to: California Protected Areas Database (CPAD), California Conservation Easement Database (CCED), California School Campus Database (CSCD) and important farmlands from Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program (FMMP). It is quite possible that many of the parcels identified as possibly economically underutilized, and therefore ripe for infill development, may be neither physically deteriorated nor economically under-valued. Based on the approach used to identify the infill sites, it is not known which, if any, of the identified infill sites might be made available by their current owners for sale or development. Therefore, it should be noted that the analysis presented in this study is essentially a starting point for more detailed analyses to be undertaken in collaboration with local governments.

![tier2taz](images/scag_10_11_17/tier2_taz.png) _Tier2 TAZ_

SCAG developed the Transportation Analysis Zones (TAZ) for the SCAG Region, based on the 2010 Tiger Census Block. This is used to facilitate Travel Demand and Land Use Modeling needs at SCAG.

![city_boundary](images/scag_10_11_17/city_boundary.png) _City Boundary_

This dataset includes the updated as of August 26, 2016 city boundaries for all SCAG counties. The dataset is comprised of data collected from each of the 6 counties contained within the SCAG region. The data represents the city boundary for each of the 191 cities in the region. Data was obtained from county LAFCOs (except for Imperial County) to reflect the most current updates and annexations to the city boundaries. The original data sources were the local LAFCO offices and County Assessor’s Office (for Imperial County cities ONLY).

### **_Reference Layers_**

This group of layers includes: (1) Scenario Planning Zone (SPZ) boundaries; (2) resource areas and farmland  information in the region obtained from state and federal data sources; (3) information related to a transit priority project compiled pursuant to Government Code Section 65080(b)(2)(H); and (3) boundaries of administrative district and Census geography.  

![scenario_planning_zones](images/scag_10_11_17/scenario_planning_zones.png) _Scenario Planning Zones_

Scenario Planning Zone (SPZ) is a spatial boundary that SCAG developed as the minimum unit of scenario planning and analysis for the SPM. It was developed by grouping parcels of uniform or compatible land uses while maintaining manageable size for capturing local land use benefits on transportation, varied by development density and intensity. The SPZs maintain a nesting relationship with existing boundaries such as parcel, Tier 2/3 TAZ, Community Planning Area, City, Subregion, and County.

![sphere_of_influence](images/scag_10_11_17/sphere_of_influence.png) _Sphere of Influence_

The Sphere of Influence information represents the geographic extent to which a city can expand by annexation. Data was obtained from the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) of each county. For inaccuracy or changes in sphere of influences, local jurisdictions need to contact LAFCO to reflect the most accurate boundaries.

![farmland](images/scag_10_11_17/farmland_map_icon.png) _Farmland_

Farmland information was obtained from the Farmland Mapping & Monitoring Program (FMMP) in the Division of Land Resource Protection in the California Department of Conservation. The FMMP is to provide consistent and impartial data and analysis of agricultural land use and land use changes throughout the State of California. SCAG obtains the Important Farmland Map created by FMMP, which is updated biennially based on a computer mapping system, aerial imagery, public review, and field interpretation. The classification system of farmland was developed by combing technical soil rating and current land use, as shown in Table A1.

#### **Table A1: Definition of Types of Farmland**

| Symbol | Value | Definition |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| ![Prime Farmland](images/scag_10_11_17/prime_farmland.png) | Prime Farmland (P) | Farmland with the best combination of physical and chemical features able to sustain long term agricultural production. This land has the soil quality, growing season, and moisture supply needed to produce sustained high yields. Land must have been used for irrigated agricultural production at some time during the four years prior to the mapping date. |
| ![Farmland](images/scag_10_11_17/farmland_of_statewide.png) | Farmland of Statewide Importance (S) | Farmland similar to Prime Farmland but with minor shortcomings, such as greater slopes or less ability to store soil moisture. Land must have been used for irrigated agricultural production at some time during the four years prior to the mapping date. |
| ![Farmland](images/scag_10_11_17/unique_farmland.png) | UNIQUE FARMLAND (U) | Farmland of lesser quality soils used for the production of the state's leading agricultural crops. This land is usually irrigated, but may include non-irrigated orchards or vineyards as found in some climatic zones in California. Land must have been cropped at some time during the four years prior to the mapping date. |
| ![Farmland](images/scag_10_11_17/farmland_of_local.png) | Farmland of Local Importance (L) | Land of importance to the local agricultural economy as determined by each county’s board of supervisors and a local advisory committee. |
| ![Farmland](images/scag_10_11_17/grazing_land.png) | Grazing Land (G) | Land on which the existing vegetation is suited to the grazing of livestock. This category was developed in cooperation with the California Cattleman’s Association, University of California Cooperative Extension, and other groups interested in the extent of grazing activities. The minimum mapping unit for Grazing Land is 40 acres. |
| ![Urban And Built-Up Land](images/scag_10_11_17/urban_and_built_up.png) | Urban and Built-up Land (D) | Land occupied by structures with a building density of at least 1 unit to 1.5 acres, or approximately 6 structures to a 10-acre parcel. This land is used for residential, industrial, commercial, institutional, public administrative purposes, railroad and other transportation yards, cemeteries, airports, golf courses, sanitary landfills, sewage treatment, water control structures, and other developed purposes. |
| ![Other Land](images/scag_10_11_17/other_land.png) | Other Land (X) | Land not included in any other mapping category. Common examples include low density rural developments; brush, timber, wetland, and riparian areas not suitable for livestock grazing; confined livestock, poultry or aquaculture facilities; strip mines, borrow pits; and water bodies smaller than 40 acres. Vacant and nonagricultural land surrounded on all sides by urban development and greater than 40 acres is mapped as Other Land. |
| ![Water](images/scag_10_11_17/water.png) | Water (W) | Perennial water bodies with an extent of at least 40 acres. |
| ![Not Surveyed](images/scag_10_11_17/not_surveyed.png) | Not Surveyed (Z) | Large government land holdings, including National Parks, Forests, and Bureau of Land Management holdings are not included in FMMP’s survey area. |

![CPAD Holdings](images/scag_10_11_17/cpad_holdings.png) _CPAD Holdings_

California Protected Area Database (CPAD) is a GIS inventory of all publicly owned protected open space lands in the State of California through fee ownership.

The “protected” status in CPAD does not refer to a specific level of conservation for biodiversity values, but a general commitment to maintain the property for open space uses. The lands in CPAD are defined based on the agencies that own the fee title to the property, not the managing parties. Also, CPAD is not the database of all public lands, but that of all “publicly owned” open space. The owning agencies include public and non-profits, but currently the private owners and properties under the use of easements are excluded.

![habitat_conservation_areas](images/scag_10_11_17/habitat_conservation_areas.png) _Habitat Conservation Areas_

This data set is from the Natural Community Conservation Planning (NCCP) program of California Department of Fish and Wildlife. The primary objective of the NCCP program is to conserve natural communities at the ecosystem level, while accommodating compatible land use. By considering the long-term stability of wildlife and plant communities, and including key interests in the planning process, it aims at anticipating and preventing the controversies in the surrounding areas of the species.

A local agency is in charge of monitoring the development of a conservation plan in cooperation with landowners, environmental organizations and other interest parties.  The Department of Fish and Wildlife provides necessary support, direction, and guidance to NCCP participants.

![endangered_species](images/scag_10_11_17/endangered_species.png) _Endangered Species_

SCAG obtained the California Natural Diversity Database (CNDDB) July 2013 version developed by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife’s Biogeographic Data Branch (BDB). The CNDDB is a library of the location and condition of species of rate and sensitive plants, animals, and natural communities in California. It is updated on a continuous basis to be consistent and current, but cannot be an exhaustive and comprehensive inventory of rare species and natural communities. Field verification for the absence and presence of sensitive species is required by the end users.

The types of elements are specified as four categories of plant, animal, terrestrial community, and aquatic community, as shown in the Table A3.

#### **Table A3: Definition of Types of Elements (ELMTYPE)**

| Symbol | Value | Definition |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| ![Plant](images/scag_10_11_17/1_plant.png) | 1 | Plant (ELMCODEs beginning with “P” or “N”) |
| ![Animal](images/scag_10_11_17/2_animal.png) | 2 | Animal (ELEMCODEs beginning with “A” or “I”) |
| ![Terrestrial Community](images/scag_10_11_17/3_terrestrial_community.png) | 3 | Terrestrial community (ELMCODEs beginning with “CT”) |
| ![Acquatic Community](images/scag_10_11_17/4_acquatic_community.png) | 4 | Aquatic community (ELMCODEs beginning with ”CA”, “CE”, CL”, “CM” or “CR” |

The precision or accuracy level (ACC_CLASS) represents spatial uncertainty on a scale of one to ten, indicating both accuracy type and accuracy value.

#### **Table A4: Definition of Precision or Accuracy Level (ACC_CLASS)**

| Value | Definition |

| 5 mile | 10: Circular feature with a 8,000 meter radius (5 miles) |

![flood_zones](images/scag_10_11_17/flood_zones.png) _Flood Zones_

The flood zones data is based on the Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map (DFIRM), obtained from Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in October 2013. The DFIRM Database is a digital version of the FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) that is designed for use with digital mapping and analysis software. The FIRM is created by FEMA for the purpose of floodplain management, mitigation, and insurance activities for the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).

The FIRM includes data on the 100-year (1% annual chance of occurring) and 500-year (0.2% annual chance of occurring) floodplains (column “flood_zone”). This data set included in the SPM is prepared at the county level for better presentation of the flood areas, which is normally not constrained to city limits.

![Major Transit Stops](images/scag_10_11_17/major_transit_stops.png) _Major Transit Stops_

A site containing an existing rail transit station, a ferry terminal served by either a bus or rail transit service, or the intersection of two or more major bus routes with a frequency of service interval of 15 minutes or less during the morning and afternoon peak commute periods (CA Public Resource Code Section 21064.3). It also includes major transit stops that are included in the applicable regional transportation plan.

Please note that this map may undergo changes as SCAG continues to update its transportation network. Updates to this information will be forthcoming as information becomes available.

![High Quality Transit Corridors](images/scag_10_11_17/high_quality_transit_corridors.png) _High Quality Transit Corridors_

A corridor with fixed route bus service with service intervals no longer than 15 minutes during peak commute hours.

Please note that this map may undergo changes as SCAG continues to update its transportation network. Updates to this information will be forthcoming as information becomes available.

![High Quality Transit Areas](images/scag_10_11_17/high_quality_transit_areas.png) _High Quality Transit Areas_

SCAG’s High Quality Transit Area (HQTA) is within one-half mile from major transit stops and high quality transit corridors and developed based on the language in SB375. This is the HQTA in the SCAG Region for planned year 2040, extracted from are extracted from the 2016-2040 RTP/SCS Amendment #2 2040 planned year transit network data. The definition that SCAG has been using for the HQTA is based on the language in SB375.

Please note that this map may undergo changes as SCAG continues to update its transportation network. Updates to this information will be forthcoming as information becomes available.

![Transit Priority Areas](images/scag_10_11_17/transit_priority_areas.png) _Transit Priority Areas_

As defined in SB 743, “Transit Priority Area” means an area within one-half mile of a major transit stop that is existing or planned, if the planned stop is scheduled to be completed within the planning horizon included in a Transportation Improvement Program adopted pursuant to Section 450.216 or 450.322 of Title 23 of the Code of Federal Regulations. To assist in identifying the transit priority areas, SCAG identifies the major transit stops and their surrounding areas in one-half mile radius distance for year 2040. Major transit stops are extracted from the 2016-2040 RTP/SCS Amendment #2 2040 planned year transit network data.

Please note that this map may undergo changes as SCAG continues to update its transportation network. Updates to this information will be forthcoming as information becomes available.

![Census Tracts](images/scag_10_11_17/census_tracts.png) _Census Tracts_

Census Tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or equivalent entity, and were defined by local participants as part of the 2010 Census Participant Statistical Areas Program. The Census Bureau delineated the census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where all the potential participants declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of census data and comparison back to previous decennial censuses. Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement.

![Sub Region](images/scag_10_11_17/sub_region.png) _Sub Region_

This dataset contains the official subregional boundaries for the SCAG region. The data has been updated as of August 2013 to incorporate changes in Western Riverside Council of Governments (WRCOG) and Coachella Valley Association of Governments (CVAG) in the County of Riverside.

![Sea Level Rise](images/scag_10_11_17/sea_level_rise.png) _Sea Level Rise 1ft/2ft_

The purpose of this dataset is to show potential sea level rise inundation 1 feet/2 feet above current Mean Higher High Water (MHHW) for the area. This data was created as part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Coastal Services Center’s efforts to create an online mapping viewer depicting potential sea level rise and its associated impacts on the nation’s coastal areas. The Sea Level Rise and Coastal Flooding Impacts Viewer may be accessed at http:///www.csc.noaa.gov/slr. This dataset was derived from two different data sources: the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the area and a tidal surface model that represents spatial tidal variability.
