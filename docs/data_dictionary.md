***2012	Existing	Land	Use Parcels***

The	base	year	of	the 2016-2040	RTP/SCS	is 2012.	To	develop	the	base	year	
existing	land	use	data,	SCAG	used	property	land	use	information	acquired	
from	Digital	Map	Products	(DMP)	and	SCAG’s	2008	existing	land	use	data.	DMP	land	use	
codes	were	converted	to	SCAG’s	standardized	Existing	Land	Use	code system.	For	detailed	
information	on	the	Existing	Land	Use	codes,	please	refer	to	Table	B1 in	Appendix	B.	

Beginning	in	August	2013,	the	2012	existing	land	use	maps	were	reviewed	by	local	
jurisdictions	and	revised	based	on	the	local	input	and	comments.	The	information	available	
via	SPM	reflects	the	local	inputs	received	by August	22,	2014.

***General	Plan	Parcels***	

The	general	plan	and	zoning	documents,	maps,	and/or	GIS	shapefiles	collected
from	local	jurisdictions were	coded	into	GIS	shapefiles	at	the	parcel	level.	
Parcel	boundary	data	were	acquired	from	DMP.	The	General	Plan	Parcels	layer	is	prepared	
with	SCAG’s	standardized	General	Plan	codes.	For	detailed	information	on	the	standardized	
general	plan	codes,	please	refer	to	Table	B2 in	Appendix	B.	The	information	available	via	
SPM	reflects	the	local	inputs	received	by	August	22,	2014.	

***Scenario	Planning	Zones***

Scenario	Planning	Zone (SPZ) is	a	spatial	boundary	that	SCAG	developed	as	the	minimum	
unit	of scenario	planning	and	analysis	for the	SPM.	It	was	developed	by	grouping	parcels	of	
uniform	or	compatible	land	uses	while	maintaining	manageable	size	for	capturing	local	land	
use	benefits	on	transportation,	varied	by	development	density	and	intensity.	The SPZs	
maintain	a	nesting	relationship	with	existing	boundaries	such	as	parcel,	Tier	2/3	TAZ,	
Community	Planning	Area,	City,	Subregion,	and	County.		
	
***Jurisdiction	Boundary	and	Sphere	of	Influence***

Jurisdiction boundary	and	Sphere	of	Influence	information	are	from	each	
County’s	Local	Agency	Formation	Commissions	(LAFCO).	The	information	
included	here	are	as	of	July	2012. SCAG	uses	the	data	directly	from	LAFCO	as	the	legitimate	
source	based	on	the	legal	requirement	of	SB385. For	inaccuracy	or	changes	in	jurisdiction	
boundaries	or	sphere	of	influences,	local	jurisdictions	need	to	contact	LAFCO	to	reflect	the	
most	accurate	boundaries.	

***Tier2	TAZ***
	
SCAG	developed	the	Transportation	Analysis	Zones	(TAZ)	for	the	SCAG	Region,	
based	on	the	2010	Tiger	Census	Block.	This	is	used	to	facilitate	Travel	Demand	
and	Land	Use	Modeling	needs	at	SCAG.
	
	
### County		
This	group	of	countywide	layers	includes:	(1)	resource	areas	and	farmland information	in	
the	region obtained	from	state	and	federal	data	sources;	(2)	information	related	to	a	transit	
priority	project	compiled	pursuant	to	Government	Code	Section	65080(b)(2)(H);	and	(3)	
boundaries	of	administrative	district	and	Census	geography.	See	Government	Code	section	65080.01 for definitions	of	“resource	areas”	and	“farmland.”	

***Farmland***

Farmland	information	was	obtained	from	the	Farmland	Mapping	&	
Monitoring	Program	(FMMP)	in	the	Division	of	Land	Resource	Protection	in	
the	California	Department	of	Conservation.	The	FMMP	is	to	provide	consistent	and	
impartial	data	and	analysis	of	agricultural	land	use	and	land	use	changes	throughout	the	
State	of	California.	SCAG	obtains	the	Important	Farmland	Map	created	by	FMMP.	The	study	
area	is	in	accordance	to	the	soil	survey	developed	by	National	Resources	Conservation	
Service	(NRCS)	in	the	United	States	Department	of	Agriculture.	Important	Farmland	Map	is	
biennially	updated	based	on	a	computer	mapping	system,	aerial	imagery,	public	review,	and	
field	interpretation.	The	minimum	land	use	mapping	unit	is	10	acres.	The	classification	
system	of	farmland	(column	“polygon_fy”)	was	developed	by	combing	technical	soil	rating	
and	current	land	use,	as	shown	in	Table	A4.	The	information	available	via	SPM	reflects	the	
local	inputs	received	by	August	22,	2014.
	
	
### Table	B1:	Definition	of	Types	of	Farmland	(polygon_fy)

|	Symbol	|	Value	|	Definition	|
|	--------------------	|	--------------------	|	--------------------	|
|		|	Prime Farmland (P)	|	Farmland with the best combination of physical and chemical features able to sustain long term agricultural production. This land has the soil quality, growing season, and moisture supply needed to produce sustained high yields. Land must have been used for irrigated agricultural production at some time during the four years prior to the mapping date.	|
|		|	Farmland of Statewide Importance (S)	|	Farmland similar to Prime Farmland but with minor shortcomings, such as greater slopes or less ability to store soil moisture. Land must have been used for irrigated agricultural production at some time during the four years prior to the mapping date.	|
|		|	UNIQUE FARMLAND (U)	|	Farmland of lesser quality soils used for the production of the state's leading agricultural crops. This land is usually irrigated, but may include non-irrigated orchards or vineyards as found in some climatic zones in California. Land must have been cropped at some time during the four years prior to the mapping date.	|
|		|	Farmland of Local Importance (L)	|	Land of importance to the local agricultural economy as determined by each county’s board of supervisors and a local advisory committee.	|
|		|	Grazing Land (G)	|	Land on which the existing vegetation is suited to the grazing of livestock. This category was developed in cooperation with the California Cattleman’s Association, University of California Cooperative Extension, and other groups interested in the extent of grazing activities. The minimum mapping unit for Grazing Land is 40 acres.	|
|		|	Urban and Built-up Land (D)	|	Land occupied by structures with a building density of at least 1 unit to 1.5 acres, or approximately 6 structures to a 10-acre parcel. This land is used for residential, industrial, commercial, institutional, public administrative purposes, railroad and other transportation yards, cemeteries, airports, golf courses, sanitary landfills, sewage treatment, water control structures, and other developed purposes.	|
|		|	Other Land (X)	|	Land not included in any other mapping category. Common examples include low density rural developments; brush, timber, wetland, and riparian areas not suitable for livestock grazing; confined livestock, poultry or aquaculture facilities; strip mines, borrow pits; and water bodies smaller than 40 acres. Vacant and nonagricultural land surrounded on all sides by urban development and greater than 40 acres is mapped as Other Land.	|
|		|	Water (W)	|	Perennial water bodies with an extent of at least 40 acres.	|
|		|	Not Surveyed (Z)	|	Large government land holdings, including National Parks, Forests, and Bureau of Land Management holdings are not included in FMMP’s survey area.	|

***CPAD	Holdings***

California	Protected	Area	Database	(CPAD)	is	a	GIS	inventory	of	all	publicly	
owned	protected	open	space	lands	in	the	State	of	California	through	fee	
ownership.	GreenInfo	Network	has	prepared	CPAD	by	aggregating	and	cross-checking	
various	open	space	data	from	state,	local	and	other	agencies.	

The	“protected”	status	in	CPAD	does	not	refer	to	a	specific	level	of	conservation	for	
biodiversity	values,	but	a	general	commitment	to	maintain	the	property	for	open	space	uses.	
The	lands	in	CPAD	are	defined	based	on	the	agencies	that	own	the	fee	title	to	the	property,	
not	the	managing	parties.	Also,	CPAD	is	not	the	database	of	all	public	lands,	but	that	of	all	
“publicly	owned”	open	space.	The	owning	agencies	include	public	and	non-profits,	but	
currently	the	private	owners	and	properties	under	the	use	of	easements	are	excluded.	

The	data	available	via SPM	is	presented by	ownership	(column “LAYER”) and	reflects	the	
local	inputs	received	by	August	22,	2014.

***Habitat	Conservation	Areas***

This	data	set	is	from	the	Natural	Community	Conservation	Planning	(NCCP)	
program	of	California	Department	of	Fish	and	Wildlife.	The	primary	objective	
of	the	NCCP	program	is	to	conserve	natural	communities	at	the	ecosystem	
level,	while	accommodating	compatible	land	use.	By	considering	the	long-term	stability	of	
wildlife	and	plant	communities,	and	including	key	interests	in	the	planning	process,	it	aims	
at	anticipating	and	preventing	the	controversies	in	the	surrounding	areas	of	the species.
	
A	local	agency	is	in	charge	of	monitoring	the	development	of	a	conservation	plan	in	
cooperation	with	landowners,	environmental	organizations	and	other	interest	parties.		The	
Department	of	Fish	and	Wildlife	provides	necessary	support,	direction,	and	guidance	to	
NCCP	participants.	

***Endangered	Species***

SCAG	obtained	the	California	Natural	Diversity	Database	(CNDDB)	July	2013	
version	developed	by	the	California	Department	of	Fish	and	Wildlife’s	
Biogeographic	Data	Branch	(BDB).	The	CNDDB	is	a	library	of	the	location	and	
condition	of	species	of	rate	and	sensitive	plants,	animals,	and	natural	communities	in	
California.	It	is	updated	on	a	continuous	basis	to	be	consistent	and	current,	but	cannot	be	an	
exhaustive	and	comprehensive	inventory	of	rare	species and	natural	communities.	Field	
verification	for	the	absence	and	presence	of	sensitive	species	is	required	by	the	end	users.
		
The	types	of	elements	(column	“ELMTYPE”)	are	specified	as	four	categories	of	plant,	animal,	
terrestrial	community,	and	aquatic	community,	as	shown	in	the	Table	A3.	

### Table	B3: Definition of	Types of	Elements	(ELMTYPE)

|	Symbol	|	Value	|	Definition	|
|	--------------------	|	--------------------	|	--------------------	|
|		|	1	|	Plant (ELMCODEs beginning with “P” or “N”)	|
|		|	2	|	Animal (ELEMCODEs beginning with “A” or “I”)	|
|		|	3	|	Terrestrial community (ELMCODEs beginning with “CT”)	|
|		|	4	|	Aquatic community (ELMCODEs beginning with ”CA”, “CE”, CL”, “CM” or “CR”	|

The	precision	or	accuracy	level	(ACC_CLASS)	represents	spatial	uncertainty	on	a	scale	of	
one	to	ten,	indicating	both	accuracy	type	and	accuracy	value.

***Flood	Zones***

The	flood	zones	data	is	based	on	the	Digital	Flood	Insurance	Rate	Map	
(DFIRM),	obtained	from	Federal	Emergency	Management	Agency	(FEMA)	in	
October	2013.	The	DFIRM	Database	is	a	digital	version	of	the	FEMA	Flood	Insurance	Rate	
Maps	(FIRM)	that	is	designed	for	use	with	digital	mapping	and	analysis	software.	The	FIRM	
is	created	by	FEMA	for	the	purpose	of	floodplain	management,	mitigation,	and	insurance	
activities	for	the	National	Flood	Insurance	Program	(NFIP).	

The	FIRM	includes	data	on	the	100-year	(1%	annual	chance	of	occurring)	and	500-year	(0.2%	
annual	chance	of	occurring)	floodplains	(column	“flood_zone”).	This	data	set	included	in	the	
SPM	is	prepared	at	the	county	level	for	better	presentation	of	the	flood	areas,	which	is	
normally	not	constrained	to	city	limits.	

***Major	Transit	Stops***

The	Major	Transit	Stop	information	is	extracted	from	2035	planned	year	data	in	the	2012-
2035	RTP/SCS	Amendment	#1.	It	is	defined	as	a	site	containing	a	rail	transit	station,	a	ferry	
terminal	served	by	either	a	bus	or	rail	transit	service,	or	the	intersection	of	two	or	more	
major	bus	routes	with	a	frequency	of	service	interval	of	15	minutes	or	less	during	the	
morning	and	afternoon	peak	commute	periods	(CA	Public	Resource	Code	Section	21064.3).	
It	also	includes	major	transit	stops	that	are	included	in	the	applicable	regional	
transportation	plan.	

***High Quality	Transit	Corridors***

The	High	Quality	Transit	Corridors	information	is	extracted	from	2035	
planned	year	data	in	the	2012-2035	RTP/SCS	Amendment	#1.	It	is	defined	as	
a	corridor	with	fixed	route	bus	service	with	service	intervals	no	longer	than	15	minutes	
during	peak	commute	hours.	

***High	Quality	Transit	Areas***

An	area within	one-half-mile	of	either	a	major	transit	stop or	a	high	quality	
transit	corridor,	extracted	from	2035	planned	year	data	in	the	2012-2035	
RTP/SCS	Amendment	#1.	

***Transit	Priority	Areas***

An	area	within	one-half	mile	of	a	major	transit	stop	that	is	existing	or	planned,	
if	the	planned	stop	is	scheduled	to	be	completed	within	the	planning	horizon	
included	in	a	Transportation	Improvement	Program	adopted	pursuant	to	
Section	450.216	or	450.332	of	Title	23	of	the	Code	of	Federal	Regulations.	To	assist	in	
identifying	the	transit	priority	areas,	this	data	layer	identifies	the	major	transit	stops	and	
their	surrounding	areas	in	one-half	mile	radius	distance.	Please	note	that	this	layer	is	still	in	
draft	form	and	may	undergo	changes	as	SCAG	continues	to	update	its	transportation	
network.	Updates	to	this	information	will	be	forthcoming	as	information	becomes	available.
