## **V.	User Manager**

The User Manager allows managers and admin users to manage users in their project. Non-manager or non-admin users can update their user profiles. The User Manager can be accessed from the user profile dropdown that appears by clicking on your name. Click on the ‘Manage Users’ to go to the User Management home page.
