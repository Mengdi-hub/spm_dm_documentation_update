The data review and editing framework within UrbanFootprint provides a number of data management and data review features to streamline data updating and review on the web. Using standard GIS and database attribute query and map selector tools, the user can explore data, summarize attributes, and edit configured layers. This documentation covers basic functionality for data review and editing.
Map Layers
The layer management section on the left side of the user interface allows the user to toggle ‘on’ and ‘off’ visible layers and to select the Active Layer for selection, querying, and editing.
Active Layer: The user selects the active layer by clicking on the layer name. The active layer will be highlighted in blue.
-	Any map selection, attribute query, export layer, export csv
initiated by the user will occur on the active layer. The user can select an active layer that is not visible on the map.
